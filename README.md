Here's a short video I made for my thesis, "Using Augmented Reality technolgies in the design of parts for Additive Manufacturing."

The aim of the project was to see if it was possible to make rapid prototyping a bit more rapid using AR technology. Therefore, my "Virtual Iteration" idea came about since eliminating even a single iteration while 3D printing objects would save hours of time.

This video shows the final process using the custom cloud uploader and Android App I developed.

The example shown is as if I was in the process of designing a headphone stand for 3D printing but can be anything that may need comparison with real world objects.

Even though I only finished this project at the start of May, some of the features that AR Core was sorely missing throughout the project have been released recently just showing the breakneck pace of AR development.

It incorporates Google Firebase, Android Studio, Sceneform SDK for AR apps, HTML and JS.
